# Latin Processing Web Application Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture for a web-based version of the Latin processing solution that will allow users to upload, process, and download 16th century Latin manuscripts with corrections and Dutch translations.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Bootstrap 5
- **Features**:
  - Responsive design for desktop and mobile
  - Document upload interface
  - Processing status display
  - Document preview
  - Download functionality for processed documents

### Backend
- **Framework**: Flask (Python)
- **Processing**: OpenAI API integration for Latin correction and Dutch translation
- **Document Handling**: python-docx for DOCX processing
- **Storage**: Temporary file storage for uploads and processed documents

### Deployment
- **Hosting**: Render (free tier for permanent deployment)
- **Domain**: Auto-generated subdomain from Render

## Application Components

### 1. User Interface
- **Upload Page**: Form for document upload with options for processing
- **Processing Page**: Real-time status updates during document processing
- **Results Page**: Preview of processed documents with download options

### 2. Document Processing Service
- **Document Parser**: Extracts text from uploaded DOCX files
- **Text Processor**: Integrates with OpenAI API for Latin correction and Dutch translation
- **Document Generator**: Creates new DOCX files with three-column layout

### 3. API Layer
- **Upload Endpoint**: Handles document uploads
- **Process Endpoint**: Initiates document processing
- **Status Endpoint**: Provides processing status updates
- **Download Endpoint**: Serves processed documents

## Data Flow

1. User uploads DOCX file(s) through the web interface
2. Backend validates and stores the uploaded files temporarily
3. Processing service extracts text from the documents
4. Text is sent to OpenAI API for Latin correction and Dutch translation
5. Processed text is formatted into the three-column layout
6. New DOCX files are generated and stored temporarily
7. User is provided with download links for the processed documents

## Security Considerations

- **API Key Management**: OpenAI API key stored as environment variable
- **File Validation**: Strict validation of uploaded file types and sizes
- **Temporary Storage**: Automatic cleanup of uploaded and processed files
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of the processing service

## Limitations

- **Processing Time**: OpenAI API calls may introduce latency
- **File Size**: Limits on maximum file size for uploads
- **Concurrency**: Limited number of simultaneous processing requests
- **Storage Duration**: Temporary storage of files (24-hour retention)

## Future Enhancements

- User accounts for saving processing history
- Batch processing of multiple documents
- Additional language translation options
- Custom model training for improved Latin correction
- PDF output format option
